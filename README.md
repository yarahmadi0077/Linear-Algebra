# Linear Algebra Projects

This repository contains projects developed for the Linear Algebra course at the Computer Engineering Department of Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), under the supervision of Dr. Ehsan Nazerfard.

## Projects

### 1. Leontief Model
The **Leontief Input-Output Model** is a mathematical representation used in economics to describe how different sectors of an economy interact. It models the relationship between the outputs of industries and the inputs they require from each other to produce those outputs.

#### Features:
- Implementation of the Leontief input-output model.
- Analysis of the economic dependencies among industries.
- Calculation of production levels to meet specific demand vectors.

#### Usage:
Instructions for running this project and the required input files can be found in the `leontief_model/README.md`.

---

### 2. PageRank Algorithm
The **PageRank Algorithm** is a widely used algorithm for ranking web pages in search engine results. It uses the structure of the web's hyperlink network to determine the importance of web pages.

#### Features:
- Implementation of the PageRank algorithm.
- Simulation of hyperlink structures using adjacency matrices.
- Iterative computation of page ranks until convergence.

#### Usage:
Instructions for running this project and example datasets can be found in the `pagerank_algorithm/README.md`.
